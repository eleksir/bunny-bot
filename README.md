# Bunny telegram bot

Yet another telegram bot. It has one purpose - restrict access of abusers to chat.

By now it is just proof of concept.

But there is hope that it can become useful in near future.

## Build instructions

Bot is not done yet, actually it does not do anything useful.

```bash
make
```

## Run instructions

You' don't need it it its current state. But if you want - all is simple.

```bash
./bunny-bot
```

That's it.

## Special thanks

To all active users of chat :)
